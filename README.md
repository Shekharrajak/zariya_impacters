Zariya A Safe Way to Report Violence Against Women
Zariya makes justice actionable and accessible to women facing gender-based violence.
By providing a risk-free way for women to voice their experiences, 
Zariya paves women’s paths from feeling like victims to being survivors with a right and will to justice.

Use Zariya’s online platform to report an incident of gender-based violence. In India, many women do not report sexual abuse due to societal repercussions. By sharing your story with Zariya, you can help us bridge the gap between reported statistics and unreported realities. Anonymity is guaranteed.


Zariya provides information of enforcement organs and care providers within your vicinity. Enforcement organs: police stations and courts. Care providers: rape crisis intervention centers, counselors and socio-legal information centers. FAQs are available here for additional information.


Legal action against assailants is every woman’s birthright. To seek redressal for the crimes against you, we establish connections with legal aid centers, care providers, crisis centers and the police to aid you in your (and our) quest for justice.


You can monitor the progress of your justice and redressal. We provide you with tools to ensure that your legal demands and social, emotional and psychological needs are met. We believe that providing a gateway to report, access, connect and track are key process elements for enacting justice in the lives of survivors of gender-based violence.
